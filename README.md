### cycleGAN

This is a repo using CycleGAN [a.k.a. Cycle-consistent GAN](https://paperswithcode.com/method/cyclegan) to conduct neural-style transfer, converting between comic faces and real faces.

The train and test dataset comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/defileroff/comic-faces-paired-synthetic). Considering the time and computing power, only a small subset of the dataset is chosen.
